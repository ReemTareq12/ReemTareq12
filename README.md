Hi Iâ€™m Reem. 
I have a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. 
Despite facing challenges, including leaving my homeland of Palestine and starting new in Egypt, I remain committed to pursuing my goals and making a positive impact on my community. 
I enjoy baking, which allows me to express my creativity and bring joy to others. 
I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to create meaningful change and improve lives.
